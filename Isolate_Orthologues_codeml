#Isolate CDs and seach Orthologues with Orthoscope
paste accession code such as XM*** in NCBI
copy CDs sequences
paste fasta file of the CDs in Orthoscope for Acropora(https://orthoscope.jp/orthoscope/Acropora.html)

# download the isolated result and check the cluster of youseq
grep -A *** "name of top OTU name of cluster" >SNP**.fasta

#align sequences with mafft and check at websites. If the sequences are not well aligned and lack of the seqeuences, remove these OTU. If the sequences are well aligned the file should be transformed as Nexus format
#check the aligned file with Mesquite
#visalization of codon is convenient for checking the file
#Transformed aligned file to phylip file and build a ML tree with RaxML or RaxML-ng

#if ΔlnL>2.76, positive selection is supported.
